Final Project


Brief Description:
Hi, my final project is a matching game run in the terminal. It is based on a class called tile and its properties. The user has an option between 3 levels that differ in number of tiles and (if selected) also differ in amount of time granted for matching all the tiles each getting increasingly more difficult. While playing the game, the code keeps track of time elapsed and number of guesses. Then at the end there is a comparison to see if the play earned a spot as high score. Also the files in Xcode are very specific about where they will be seen / written to- I believe the way that I zipped it is correct but it was strange because my updated high score file was in my build with my executables and not the folder with my .cpp files - there were two copies and the one with the .cpp's was older.

(Note: high score file is formatted like this:
Level 1, time HS
Level 1, num guess HS
Level 2, time HS
Level 2, num guess HS
Level 3, time HS
Level 3, num guess HS )




Game Play Instructions:
1) Compile and run the files (including the .txt files)
2) Look to the terminal for further direction.
